# Functional Programming Essentials

- Explore the toolbox, C and Python were Imperative and object oriented respectively.

### Credo

- All programming paradigms are usefull
    - they all serve different purposes
- functional programming concepts are appearing in *all* other languages.
- FP is useful in its own right in several industries
- Functional programming might rise as our new overloard (wishful thinking)

### Botttom Line

- We have left Kansas and left Python behind us.
- Haskell is immutable.
- Pure functional language
- Very *nice* / light syntax
- *Concise* and *elegant* (The less code you write, the less bugs you have)
    - You will be tempted to write long functions. This is a bad reflex.
- **Statically** and **Strongly** typed
- Threaded (Green threads)
- Compiled and Fast
- Useable.
- Should be fun.

## Overview

- Fundamentals of FP programming
- Mastery of recursion, higher order, kinds
- Mastery of sophisticated typed languages
- Full understanding of GADTs (Generalized Algebraic Data Types)
- Mastery of Functor, Applicative and Monads
- Lateral Learning for other languages

## Tooling

- GHCup
    - Stack
    - Compiler ghc 9.6.7
    - Snapshot: lts-22.44

- VSCode possible, but not reccommended
- Git

## Expectations

- Program every week.

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
| -------| ----    | --------- | -------- | ------ | -------  | ----   |
| Answer questions | Lecture | Problem Set Due | Problem Set Released |  |  | Solution released before homework |


- This is just an introduction to FP. This is not full encompassed class.

- Z-scored
